<p> My name is S M Hasib. I am 22 years old and read in 10th semester in AIUB . I am the second child of my parents and I have an elder Sister. I have a group of 5 friends however XYZ is my best friend. He is true, honest and looks so nice. We both are in the same class and school. Normally, I like to hear and tell jokes and stories to my friends. I help my younger cousins in doing their home works daily. I love my parents very much. They also love me and promote me to do well in every field. They motivate and inspire me to study. My family is a cultural family. When we celebrate each festival together, we enjoyed it and have a great time. Really, I am fortunate to have this family.</p>
